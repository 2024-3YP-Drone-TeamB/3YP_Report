\subsection{Conclusion}\label{Huirui_conclusion}

This section presented the design of a \gls{UAV}-based system for detecting both surface and buried landmines. A layered sensing approach was adopted: a high-altitude (6~m) thermal infrared camera (FLIR Vue Pro) at 9~mm lens performs wide-area scanning, selected for its balance of resolution, sensitivity, weight, and cost. Suspected landmine positions are then verified at low altitude (2~m) using a \gls{DLGPR} (the SPH Engineering Zond Aero 1000 MHz \gls{GPR}) with Stripmap \gls{SAR} and \gls{BP} processing at a spatial sampling interval of 11.5~cm to enhance lateral resolution. This architecture ensures reliable detection while maximizing coverage efficiency and operational safety.
