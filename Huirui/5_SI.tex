\subsection{Sensor Integration}

\subsubsection{Sensor Integration and Data Handling}
- Data interfaces and storage solutions (e.g., onboard SD logging).

- Software hooks for starting/stopping recording and syncing data with GPS.

\subsubsection{Preprocessing and Onboard Processing}
- Initial data cleaning or transformation (e.g., filtering GPR signals).

- Localization tagging for thermal and radar data.

- Mention potential for real-time or offline processing.
