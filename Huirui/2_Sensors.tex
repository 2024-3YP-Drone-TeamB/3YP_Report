\subsubsection{Landmine Detection Techniques}
- Overview of detection modalities: optical, thermal, metal detectors, GPR, chemical sensors.

- Detection principles and drone applicability.

- Pros/cons table or matrix comparing modalities.

\subsubsection{Evaluation and Selection of Sensors}
- Justification for excluding some methods.

- Final selection of thermal camera and GPR based on weight, cost, feasibility, and performance.

- Reference to real-world drone-based landmine studies.
