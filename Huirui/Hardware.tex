\section{Hardware} \label{hardware}

\subsection{Introduction and Objectives}
- Justification for customized drone design: Why commercial drones (e.g., DJI) are insufficient.

- Advantages of using an online customizable CAD-based drone platform (modularity, structural flexibility, control system compatibility).

- Mention modularity design of data acquisition sensors like thermal camera and gpr 

\subsection{Drone Hardware Overview}
- Summary table or list of all onboard components (e.g., frame, motors, propellers, flight controller, battery, onboard computer, altimeter, Lidar, thermal camera, GPR).

- Clarify which components are selected vs. pending.

- Mention which hardware sections are handled by others (e.g., flight controller by Tommy, battery by Sam).

\subsection{Component Selection and Justification}
\subsubsection{Motor and Propeller}
- Discussion of thrust needs, compatibility with drone frame, and upgrade potential.
\subsubsection{Onboard Computer}
- Requirements for processing, data logging, and compatibility.
\subsubsection{Altitude Sensors: Barometer and Lidar}
- Roles of barometer and Lidar (altitude estimation, obstacle avoidance).

- Justification for sensor selection.
\subsubsection{Sensor Mounting and Integration}
- Physical and data interface integration for all components (CAD model with thermal camera or gpr mounted on).
