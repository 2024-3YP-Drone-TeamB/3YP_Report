\subsection{Thermal Camera}

\subsubsection{Key Parameters and Theoretical Considerations}
- Wavelength range, frame rate, resolution, and altitude impact.

- Factors affecting thermal signature (e.g., burial depth, surface heating).

\subsubsection{Example Hardware and Final Selection}
- Summary of camera options and rationale for choice.

\subsubsection{Sensor Operation and Flight Parameter Configuration}
- Flying height, scanning resolution, and field of view.

- Guidelines from theory and past work to inform drone altitude and speed.
