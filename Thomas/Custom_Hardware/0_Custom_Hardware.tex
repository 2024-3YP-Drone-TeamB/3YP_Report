\subsection{Introduction and Philosophy}
Due to the specific operating environment, custom hardware is required. This is because the device cannot safely carry out emergency landing procedures when a fault is detected due to the difficulty of retrieval. Furthermore, any crashes can damage the onboard imaging sensors. Lastly, there is significant opportunity cost of delaying mapping as the equipment and manpower involved in demining would be ineffective until retrieval and repair or replacement of the device. 
\paragraph{When to use custom components}
\gls{COTS} options should always be considered before any custom part due to the significant design and testing costs associated with custom parts. Furthermore, \gls{COTS} options will often have shorter lead times and will benefit from sourcing at greater scales. However, when there are specific design requirements not met in the current market custom components need to be used.
\paragraph{Objectives}
All hardware should be easy and quick to debug, it should support redundancy and it should be as modular as possible. Furthermore, they should also line up with our sustainability and inclusion objectives by ensuring all components are \gls{RoHS} compliant and, where applicable, should support those with disabilities. I will design core components demonstrating the design principles explored however, not all hardware components are considered and there is significant room for future work.
