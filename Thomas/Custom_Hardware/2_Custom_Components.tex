\subsection{Custom Components}\label{sub_sub_section:tgt_custom_components}

\subsubsection{Component Selection}\label{sub_sub_section:tgt_component_selection}
\input{Thomas/Custom_Hardware/component_choices_IMU}
\paragraph{\gls{IMU}}
While the BMI323 is cheaper, it has higher noise characteristics than the ICM-42688-P, therefore, the latter was selected for use on all boards due to its low price point and high performance. The use of the same \gls{IMU} over all modules should be maintained if possible, so that the control characteristics are unchanged across devices and lower costs due to higher order quantities and reduced supply chain dependencies.
\paragraph{\gls{MCU}}
\input{Thomas/Custom_Hardware/component_choices_MCU}
For the flight controller, the STM32H743VGT6 is the best option given its \gls{RAM}, price point, and support of dual \gls{CAN} buses. However, for the less computationally intense operations required for the \gls{GNSS} module, the smaller footprint (due to the lower number of pins) and far lower priced MSPM0G3506SRHBR is a better option.
\paragraph{\gls{GNSS} Module}
\input{Thomas/Custom_Hardware/component_choices_GNSS}
Exact positions for where the images were taken to centimetre accuracy are required as discussed in Section \ref{GPR_design}, this is possible using a \gls{RTK} setup with a base station sending out correction vectors over LoRa, getting within centimetre accuracy\cite{RTK_LORA}. Furthermore, in the case of the loss of all \gls{GNSS} signals, built-in dead reckoning could provide positional data used in \gls{RTS}.  Therefore, the LG69T-AP is selected. However, given the lack of officially released dead-reckoning data, it would have to be assessed in real-world trials before deployment. When not executing imaging tasks, \gls{RTK} precision is not needed, and the modules are more expensive than the \gls{GNSS} modules without \gls{RTK}. Therefore, for the redundant device, the MAX-F10S-00B was selected,  due to the significantly better documentation available and similar price points when compared to the LC29HAAMD.

\subsubsection{Power Supply}\label{sub_sub_section:tgt_power_supply}
\input{Thomas/Custom_Hardware/current_draws}
\paragraph{Main Power Supply}
In both the GNSS module and the flight controller module, the same power setup was used. The key decision metrics were efficiency and cost.  Efficiency is of high importance due to the thermal management on the board. A step-down buck converter selected has over 90\% efficiency throughout the expected operating current window \cite{ti} shown in Table \ref{tab:current-draws}. As shown in the schematic in Figure \ref{fig:power_supply_schematic}, there is a fuse to protect from short circuits and a \gls{TVS} diode to protect against \gls{ESD} that someone connecting the power might cause. There are also capacitors of 22uF and 4.7uF to smooth the power supply current transients.
\input{Thomas/Custom_Hardware/power_supply}
\paragraph{Backup Power Supply}
The telemetry recordings of the flight controller are vital for crash analysis. However, in cases of sudden electrical failure, the data recording will stop before writing the final state vectors and error codes. For example, if before a short circuit the current drawn from an \gls{ESC} starts spiking, that message needs to be recorded even if a fuse immediately burns, shutting down the power supply. Therefore, a supercapacitor in series with a 20$\ohm$ resistor is used as shown in Figure \ref{fig:power_supply_schematic}. The capacitor selected is rated up to 5.4V at 0.47F \cite{rs_supercap}. 
\begin{equation}
t = \frac{C \cdot (V_0 - V_{\text{cutoff}})}{I}
\label{eq:discharge_time}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
t_{\text{worst-case}} = \frac{0.47 \cdot (3.3 - 2.8)}{1} = 0.235\ \text{seconds}
\label{eq:worst_case_time}
\end{equation}
The worst-case time before dropout is over 0.2 seconds as shown in Equation \ref{eq:worst_case_time}, which will provide sufficient time to record any last messages. Furthermore, the time constant is $\tau = RC = 20 \cdot 0.47 = 9.4\ \text{seconds}$, meaning that there are current spikes when turning the device on, but it is still charged over 3V within 30 seconds as shown in Figure \ref{fig:charging_curve}.

\subsubsection{Comparison to Commercial Options}\label{sub_sub_section:tgt_commercial_options}
\input{Thomas/Custom_Hardware/BOMs}
The CUAV X7+\footnote{\url{https://store.cuav.net/shop/x7/}} GPS-compatible option costs £339.75 per unit and provides the same core functionality as the custom flight controller. This can be combined with the CUAV C-RTK 9Ps Positioning Module\footnote{\url{https://store.cuav.net/shop/c-rtk-9ps/}} that costs £332.91 for a drone-based station pair and provides \gls{RTK} \gls{GNSS}. Further, the NEO 3 Pro is a simple \gls{GNSS} module that costs £126.95 and can replace the redundant \gls{GNSS} module\footnote{\url{https://store.cuav.net/shop/neo-3-pro/}}. This is a significant increase in unit cost; however, it would not require development, testing, and comes with FCC and CE compliance. To judge which option should be used, compliance was estimated at £4000\footnote{\url{https://www.spierssafety.co.uk/article/what-cost-ce-marking/}} and further testing at £3000 for each module. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:price_curve}, both the redundant \gls{GNSS} module and flight controller become economically viable by 100 units. Therefore, at even medium-scale production, it is economically viable to manufacture these custom components.
