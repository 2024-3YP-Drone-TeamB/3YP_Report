\subsection{Custom Components}

\subsubsection{Component Selection}
\input{Thomas/Custom_Hardware/component_choices}
\paragraph{\gls{IMU}}
While the BMI323 is cheaper, and should be fine for a 8kHz control system, it does not have the specifications required for further modification, improvement and advanced sensor fusion. Therefore, the ICM-42688-P was selected for use on all boards due to its low price point and high performance. The use of the same \gls{IMU} over all modules should be maintained if possible so that the control characteristics are unchanged across devices.
\paragraph{\gls{MCU}}
For the flight controller the STM32H743VGT6 is the best option given its \gls{RAM}, price point and support of dual \gls{CAN} buses. However, for the less computationally intense operations required for the \gls{GNSS} module the smaller footprint (due to the lower number of pins) and lower priced MSPM0G3506SRHBR is a better option.
\paragraph{\gls{GNSS} Module}
Exact positions for where the images were taken is required, this is possible using a \gls{RTK} setup with a base station sending out correction vectors over LoRA \cite{a source}, taking the accuracy to within 1cm at 10 Hz \footnote{\url{the data sheet}}. Furthermore, in the case of the loss of all \gls{GNSS} signal built in dead reckoning, allowing \gls{RTS}, is also a desirable feature. Therefore, the LG69T-AP is selected. However, when not executing imaging tasks, this precision is not needed and the modules are more expensive than the \gls{GNSS} modules without these features. Therefore, for the redundant device the MAX-F10S-00B was selected, and is shown in \ref{fig:custom_hardware_overview}, due to the significantly better documentation available and similar price points when compared to the LC29HAAMD.

\subsubsection{Comparison to Commercial Options}
\paragraph{Flight Controller}
\textbf{NICE TABLE}
\paragraph{\gls{GNSS} Module}
Given the specific use case there are no other commercial options that support \gls{CAN} communication and can control the drone in case of flight controller failure. However, at just \textbf{FINAL PRICE} this is competitive with GNSS Modules without either these functionalities making it an asset to the project.
