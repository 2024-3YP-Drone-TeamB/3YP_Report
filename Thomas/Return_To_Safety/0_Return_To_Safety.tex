\section{Return to Safety} \label{Return to Safety}

\subsection{Introduction and Philosophy}\label{sub_section:tgt_RTS_intro}
\gls{RTH} should always be used when possible as returning to the base is easiest and safest for ground operators. When the device experiences a significant probability of failure traditionally it carries out an emergency landing. However, in this specific operating environment emergency landing leaves the device stranded in a minefield where it cannot be retrieved. Therefore, a \gls{RTS} system is developed where it attempts to go to the nearest safe landing zone for retrieval minimising the probability of crashing in a dangerous environment and avoiding obstacles. This system should be practical, easy to use and supportive of those with disabilities.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The \gls{GUI} is easy and quick to use for untrained ground operators and supports the colour-blind. The path planning algorithm supports pre-computation that enables the device to operate \gls{RTS} with $O(1)$ memory and time complexity supporting real-time deployment. Finally, the system is built to be flexible with improvements in mind by setting up the data collection architecture to enable to the system to improve with use.
