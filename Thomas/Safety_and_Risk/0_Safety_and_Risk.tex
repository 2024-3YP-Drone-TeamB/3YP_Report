\subsection{Introduction}\label{sub_section:tgt_safety_intro}
Safety and risk is a key topic for this project. This is not only for ground operators, civilians that are negatively impacted by landmines and the business. High speed impacts are the most likely to effect all three as impacts will damage the sensors and body as well as anything that it collides with. However, with respect to the business and civilians, down-time is also a significant impact factor as the longer the drone is inactive, the higher the cost to demine an area and the more likely for injury, death and obstruction to civilians. Therefore, we aim to both minimise the risk of high speed collisions whilst ensuring that the drone is not stranded in unreachable locations, and repairs are quick and easy.

\subsection{Conclusion}
Where possible, high severity risks are mitigated with design level interventions and the device uses design to support ground operator risk reduction. Both the operator safety and the manufacturer safety are considered at the design stage and throughout to ensure that all incidents are investigated and hazards are addressed. However, all risk and safety analysis will benefit from test and deployment data for further improvements.
