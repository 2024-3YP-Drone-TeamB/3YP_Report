\section{Intra-UAV Communication Architecture} \label{Intra Communication}


\subsection{Introduction and Philosophy}
The communication and networking of devices on our device is a key consideration for design. This is because of the specific design challenges of achieving redundancy and modularity at low power and low cost. In line with these key design guidelines all interfaces and software should be as uniform as possible to reduce the training required for operation and to reduce the difficulty of creating new components for specific environments and regulations. I have considered five core components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Communications between imaging sensors and the onboard computer
    \item Communications between state estimation sensors and their local \gls{MCU}
    \item Communication between devices on the drone, for example the flight controller and the \gls{ESC}s.
    \item Communication between the onboard computer and flight controller and their respective memory devices
    \item Visual, signal and programming level debugging
\end{itemize}
This is because, each provides a unique challenge based on the varying safety criticality and data speed requirements.
