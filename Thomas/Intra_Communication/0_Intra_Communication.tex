\section{Intra-UAV Communication Architecture} \label{Intra Communication}

\subsection{Introduction and Philosophy}
The communication and networking of devices on our device is a key consideration for design. All interfaces and software should be as uniform as possible to reduce the training required for operation and to reduce the difficulty of creating new components for specific environments, applications and regulations.
