\subsection{Validation} \label{compvis_anfisvalid}

    \subsubsection{Data Generation}
    
        Physics based data generation for physics based fusion to work!
        
    \subsubsection{System Modelling}
    
        Modelling sensors, and the CNNs
    
    \subsubsection{ANFIS Implementation}
        
        Rules and high level overview of the code
    
    \subsubsection{Results and Conclusion (NB ANFIS comparison}
    
        Quantitative comparison between the two models. Show that ANFIS is better!!! Explain why this is so.
        
        Conclude that you have validated this is a good detection framework, and that we can successfully fuse the radar and thermal data together, getting better results than from either of them individually.
        
        Overall precision and recall metrics.
