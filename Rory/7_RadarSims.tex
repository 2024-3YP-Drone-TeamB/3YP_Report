\subsection{Radar Simulations} \label{compvis_radarsims}

    \subsubsection{Introduction and Physical Principles} \label{rory_radar_principles}
        As outlined in Section \ref{simulation_justification}, the limited diversity of the radar dataset necessitates physics-driven simulations to replicate the noise and clutter encountered in real-world environments. These simulations aim to validate the CNN’s robustness to physical processes that degrade B-scan clarity, ensuring reliable performance under operational conditions.
    
    The electromagnetic phenomena governing radar losses are:
    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item \textbf{Antenna losses}: Mismatch losses (approximately −1 dB \cite{daniels2005gpr}), and efficiency losses (excluded as secondary to subsurface effects).
        
        \item \textbf{Transmission losses}: Signal attenuation from reflections at air-soil and soil-air interfaces.
        
        \item \textbf{Material losses}: Frequency-dependent attenuation within heterogeneous soils.
        
        \item \textbf{Scattering losses}: Arising from subsurface inhomogeneities in soil composition, and soil surface roughness.
    
    \end{itemize}
    
    To model these effects, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations were conducted using \textit{gprMax} \cite{warren2016gprmax}, an open-source framework for solving Maxwell’s equations in 3D geophysical media. This approach captures full-wave electromagnetic behaviour, including wave propagation, reflection, and attenuation, while explicitly accounting for soil heterogeneity. The inclusion of surface roughness is not considered in this report, as for the purposes of validating the CNN-driven detection framework, modelling of subsurface heterogeneity suffices to ensure robustness to clutter. This is however a significant contribution to the clutter observed in an operational GPSAR system, and future work should consider this aspect that has been overlooked here.
 
    
    
    \subsubsection{gprMax Implementation}

        \paragraph{Radar}
        
             The source/receiver configuration follows recommendations provided by Huirui (see Section XX) and employs a Ricker waveform as the excitation signal. The Ricker waveform is widely used in GPR and seismic applications for its clear central frequency and well‐defined bandwidth properties \cite{dummyRef2}. A central frequency of 1.5\,GHz was chosen, as it provides a good compromise between penetration depth and resolution—even in moderately moist soils where deeper penetration is required. In addition, the transmitter and receiver are modelled as Herzian dipole antennas, which effectively represent the electromagnetic field distribution in practical GPR systems \cite{dummyRef3}.
    
        \paragraph{domain}
        
            The simulation domain is configured to represent a typical ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey area, with dimensions carefully chosen to encompass both the target and its surrounding environment. The landmine is modelled as a perfect electric conductor (PEC) because its high reflectivity relative to the surrounding soil makes it an ideal target in GPR surveys \cite{dummyRef6}. Soil parameter values used in the Peplinski model are based on standard measurements for sandy soils in arid regions, with dummy values provided where precise data is unavailable (see Table~\ref{tab:properties}). The simulation incorporates multiple wave interactions—including reflection, scattering, and transmission—to generate a comprehensive set of GPR responses.

    \subsubsection{Heterogeneous Soil Model}
    
        A realistic simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation necessitates an accurate representation of the subsurface. In this work, the heterogeneous soil is modelled using the Peplinski model \cite{dummyRef4}, which characterises soil dielectric properties based on sand fraction, clay fraction, bulk density, sand-particle density and volumetric water fraction range. To capture the natural spatial variability, a fractal generation technique is employed \cite{dummyRef5}. This method replicates the self-similar patterns observed in natural soils over multiple scales, thereby enhancing the fidelity of the simulation by accounting for the inherent heterogeneity in the subsurface.

    \subsubsection{Results and Validation}
    
        Figure~\ref{fig:radar_results} shows the simulated radar responses, illustrating the backscattered signatures generated by the presence of a buried landmine. These responses have been compared with real GPR data obtained from controlled field experiments \cite{dummyRef7}, demonstrating reasonable agreement. However, computational limitations restrict the number of simulations that can be feasibly run, and the current model assumes a simplified environment with flat ground, no foliage, and an absence of puddles or other surface irregularities. These factors may contribute to discrepancies between simulated and real-world data.

    \subsubsection{Data Augmentation}
    
        Running these simulations is expensive, so one should make the most of each simulation performed. From this one simulation, multiple image augmentations were applied, each representing a physical process. The transforms considered were stretching, cropping and adding Gaussian blur, and combinations of the above. When this is done to our simulated Bscan, we generate a dataset of 90 images. This is enough to test whether our pre-trained CNN is robust to heterogeneous soil properties.

    \subsubsection{CV Results}
    
        The augmented radar data were subsequently analysed using the pre-trained CNN (SECTION XX) to evaluate its efficacy in detecting buried landmines. Precision and recall metrics were calculated on the augmented dataset, with the results (summarised in Table~\ref{tab:cv_results}) indicating that the combined approach of GPSAR and advanced CV techniques is promising for practical landmine detection. In particular it is noted that we can achieve a high precision with moderate recall with the GPSAR sensor, and that the CNN, although trained on a very homogenous 'clean' dataset generalised well to a more varied dataset from high-order simulations that directly model the noise processes (which we have argued in SEC XX is very important).
        
        In summary, our results indicate that a GPSAR sensor combined with a CNN detection algorithm—developed entirely using free and open-source software—holds considerable promise for robust detection of buried landmines across a range of environments. The system's demonstrated ability to generalize to complex simulated noise suggests resilience under real-world conditions, and we believe that the current performance likely represents a conservative lower bound. With further training and additional data, significant improvements in detection accuracy are achievable, offering a highly maintainable and effective solution, that can improve as more context specific data becomes available.
