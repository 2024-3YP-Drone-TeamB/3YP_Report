\subsection{Conclusions and Future Work}

\subsubsection{Metrics}
Quantitative metrics of each of the sensors. Give a lower bound on the expected precision and recall of the two.

Chosen P/R for thermal:
Chosen P/R for GPAR:
P/R with just implicit fusion
P/R with explicit fusion too

\subsubsection{Objectives}
Summary of the framework and how we have done on our objectives
