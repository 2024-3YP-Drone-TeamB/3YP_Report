Landmine contamination is a persistent humanitarian crisis, yet current detection technologies remain slow, hazardous, and economically unviable at scale. This report presents a novel design for a multi-agent autonomous drone system for landmine detection and mapping, offering a step change in  speed and cost efficiency, especially at scale. The system uses a layered sensing approach, and leverages state of the art computer vision and data fusion algorithms to provide actionable intelligence of landmines, whilst being able to continuously learn and benefit from environmental context. Robust mission planning, control, and communication architectures—built on both COTS and bespoke hardware—are designed with safety, modularity, and redundancy in mind. The technical feasibility of the system is demonstrated through simulation under realistic operational conditions. Broader considerations of environmental, financial, ethical, and safety factors are addressed, demonstrating the potential of the system to significantly improve the safety, speed, and affordability of demining operations, restoring vast areas of land and saving countless lives.
