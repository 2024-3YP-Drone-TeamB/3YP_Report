%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{System Requirements}
\label{sec:euc_requirements}

- explain the concept of a base station
- outline what extra uav communication we need
- calculate the bit rate requirement for our information as a variable expression
- requirement to fly in various regions, laws on communication frequency

\subsection{LoRa Communication}
\label{sec:euc_lora}

- basic information on lora and lorawan
- advantages and disadvantages of lora. why we chose lora for our usecase
- power consumption. explain importance of this in our drone system
- license free sub GHz frequency bands
- spreading factor
- PHY, MAC
- security?
- modules and costs

\subsection{ns-3 Simulation}
\label{sec:euc_ns3}

- what is ns-3 simulation
- setting up the lorawan and mobility modules
- simple demonstration of drones moving in circular paths around the base station and how the data is output
- how it will be integrated into the mission planning system to ensure that the drones will stay in contact the whole mission.
